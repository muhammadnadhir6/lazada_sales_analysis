									<h2>Dataset</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">	
									<ul>
									<li><h3>Lazada Items</h3></li>
									<p>Contains <b>10.000+ rows</b> of lazada items with its ID, price, average rating, brand, category, etc.</p>
									<li><h3>Lazada Customer Review</h3></li>

									<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>We need to make sure the data is clean enough before analyzing the data to get unbiased analysis. The cleaning steps are :</p>
									<ul><li><h3>Remove irrelevant columns</h3></li>
									<p>The column in items sheet that we need to remove are url, category, total review, retrieved date, and average rating. The category column doesn't represent the product correctly so we need to remove it.
										For the review sheet we need to remove category, name, original rating, review title, review content, like count, upvotes, downvotes, helpful, relevance score, and retrieved date. 
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/b8302c4f104d79929cefcb3f2cdfde89.js"></script>
									<li><h3>Handle missing value</h3></li>
									<p>
										After running missing value check, there are <b>4</b> missing rows on brand name column and <b>7107</b> missing rows on bought date column.
										For the brand name, we fix it by defining the brand name ourselves. As for the bought date column, we fix it by removing rows that have missing value.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/07642bda398ce5afa5de88911fabd45a.js"></script>
									<li><h3>Remove duplicates</h3></li>
									<p>
										For this step, we just need to apply it on the items sheet so that there is no duplicate items with the same ID.
										As for review sheet, we don't need to because even if there is duplicated rows, it could be from different transaction.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/c14855cfb3a96af0a3a5dc8d79c62fa1.js"></script>
									<li><h3>Convert data type</h3></li>
									<p>
										Convert item ID from integer(number) to varchar and bought date from dd-mm-yyyy to yyyy-mm-dd format. 
										We also split the date by day, month, and year so that we can process it easily using python for visualization later.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/2412631da97b4291afa892e9121e4bfb.js"></script>
									<li><h3>Typo check</h3></li>
									<p>
										We need to check in case there is a typo especially for brand name column because it has too much different brand name.
										In short, what we do here are :
										<ul>
											<li>Removing space before and after brand name with "trim"</li> 
											<li>Checking and shorten if there is brand name with 2 or more space</li>
											<li>Replacing "-" and "_" with space, removing unnecessary special character</li>
											<li>Changing all similar brand name that's actually the same into exactly the same brand name</li>
											<li>Making the first letter of a brand name with 4 or more letter in uppercase</li>
											<li>Making brand name with 3 or less letter in uppercase</li>
											</ul>
									</p>
									</ul>

									<h2>Merging Data</h2>
									<h3>Merging data and categorizing items</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										In this part, we will categorize the items automatically based on the product name and then merging the items and review data.
									</p>
									<script src="https://gist.github.com/muhammadnadhir6/ced1fafab0e2158d651014b95706313f.js"></script>
								</header>
								<header class="submajor">
									<h3>Convert date type</h3>
								</header>
								<header class="text">
									<p>
										The bought date data type need to be converted from object to datetime if we want it to work properly as a date in further analysis.
										The reason why we only want to convert it now is because SQL doesn't have datetime data type so we can't convert it using SQL, and now we can convert it using Python Panda after merging the data.
